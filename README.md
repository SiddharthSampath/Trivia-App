# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out. 


## Setting up the project

Start by reading the READMEs in:

1. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)
2. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)

We recommend following the instructions in those files in order. This order will look familiar from our prior work in the course.

The documentation for the API will be present in the backend README.

## Authors

The REST API was created by Siddharth Sampath. The code for the API is present in the files __ init__.py and test_flaskr.py. The frontend was created by the Udacity team.
